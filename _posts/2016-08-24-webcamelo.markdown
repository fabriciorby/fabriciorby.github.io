description: A Java Web Project I made for college, it's a scratch of an e-commerce where you can buy anything and sell anything. The main goal here was to put in practice everything we've learned in classes, at least the most advanced things. I used SpringMVC framework to help me here. There is Bootstrap, JavaScript and JSTL also.
