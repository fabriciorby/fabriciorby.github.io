description: A Java Web Project I made for college, it's a scratch of an e-commerce where you can buy and sell anything. <br> The main goal here was to put in practice everything I've learned in classes, at least the most advanced things. <br> I used SpringMVC framework to help me here. There is Bootstrap, JavaScript and JSTL also.
